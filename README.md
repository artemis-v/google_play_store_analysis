## Wrestle the Android App Store Data into Beautiful Looking Charts with Plotly
I analyze thousands of apps in the Google Play Store to get insight into:
  1. How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
  2. Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity
  3. How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free
  4. How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app
  5. Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
  6. How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue

What I can do:
  1. Remove duplicates 
  2. Remove unwanted symbols and convert data into a numeric format
  3. Rangle columns containing nested data with Pandas
  4. Create compelling data visualizations with the plotly library
  5. Create vertical, horizontal and grouped bar charts
  6. Create pie and donut charts for categorical data
  7. Use color scales to make beautiful scatter plots
